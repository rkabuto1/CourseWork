### Programming Assignments

Throughout the course, I completed five programming assignments that progressively built upon foundational and advanced algorithmic concepts. Each assignment involved both theoretical and practical components.

1. **Assignment 1**  
   This assignment focused on the fundamentals of algorithm design and analysis, particularly the concepts of time complexity and brute-force methods. I implemented efficient algorithms to solve practical problems, performed detailed instruction counts, and engaged in mathematical computations.

2. **Assignment 2**  
   The second assignment centered on designing and analyzing algorithms using **Divide and Conquer (D&C)** or recursion. I derived recurrence equations for the algorithms through the theory section of my assigment, solved them to understand their time complexities, and implemented the solutions to demonstrate their practical applications. This assignment emphasized breaking problems into subproblems and combining their solutions effectively.

3. **Assignment 3**  
   Dynamic programming and heap data structures were the key areas of focus for this assignment. I explored the dynamic programming route to design algorithms through heaps by utilizing them for sorting operations.

4. **Assignment 4**  
   In this assignment, I worked with **graph algorithms**, particularly focusing on topological sorting and its applications. Additionally, I explored the basics of **linear programming**, implementing algorithms to solve problems in this domain. This assignment bridged the gap between theoretical graph concepts and their real world use cases.

5. **Assignment 5**  
   The final assignment revolved around **greedy algorithms**, a technique that makes locally optimal choices to solve problems efficiently.
   
### Project Assignment
The project involves an in-depth comparative analysis of **Dinicâ€™s Algorithm** and **Edmonds-Karp Algorithm** for solving maximum flow problems. Key aspects include:
- **Implementation:** Coding both algorithms.  
- **Runtime Analysis:** Detailed examination of their complexities in different scenarios.  
- **Use Case Recommendations:** When to use each algorithm based on problem size and structure.
