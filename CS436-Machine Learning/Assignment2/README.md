# Assignment II

**CS-436/536-01: Intro to Machine Learning**
**Due: 06/23 23:59**

## Description

(Please carefully follow the directions.)

### 1. Get the data and data description from the UCI repository about 3 different flowers (“Iris-setosa”, “Iris-versicolor”, “Iris-virginica”)

* Source: [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)
* Data contains 4 features/specifications (all in cm): sepal length and width, petal length and width

### 2. Build a logistic regression model using 2 features of your choice (e.g., “sepal length” and “sepal width”) as input, and any 2 flowers of your choice (e.g., “Iris-setosa” and “Iris-virginica”) as binary classifiable output.

#### Hint

* \[10 points] Plot the distribution of your selected data. More specifically, a 2D scatter plot with the axes being the 2 features.
* \[10 points] Split your data into 80% Training and 20% Testing.
* \[60 points (for model & training)] Plot the learning curve while your model is being trained (i.e., accuracy on training data vs. number of epochs).

  * Please feel free to use any value of weights and learning rate. Report your model weights upon completion of training.
* \[20 points] Report the accuracy on test data using the trained model.

  * If your model is not performing well for the flowers/features you selected, try changing your selection.
