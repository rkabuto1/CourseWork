# Assignment I

**CS-436/536-01: Intro to Machine Learning**
**Due: 06/16 23:59**

## Description

(Please carefully follow the directions and answer all the questions.)

### 1. Get the data (price of a Ford Ranger): 1992â€“2025

* Source: [https://www.cars.com/research/ford-ranger/](https://www.cars.com/research/ford-ranger/)

### 2. \[2 plots: 10 points (5 points per plot)]

Please run 2 linear regression models (one for minimum price and the other for maximum price), and plot the loss curves for 100 iterations for both cases.
What are your final model weights upon completion of training?

### 3. \[2 plots: 10 points (5 points per plot)]

You will notice that prices from 2012 to 2018 are missing. Your job is to predict the price of Ranger in those years as if Ford had produced them.
Plot the price-vs.-year curve (2 plots: min. price & max. price).

### 4. \[4 plots: 20 points (5 points per plot)]

Repeat 2. & 3. with feature scaling and dynamic learning rate.
Did you notice any improvements?

### 5. Please write a paragraph in your PDF addressing all the following questions:

* Based on your model, what is the predicted price for a Ford Ranger in 2026? Will you consider buying it?
* For each model you trained in 2. & 4., what are your thoughts on each of them? What do you think you can do to improve them?
