## Facial Recognition: CNN vs. Eigenfaces

### Purpose
This project evaluates the ethical and technical aspects of facial recognition algorithms, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Eigenfaces. It analyzes their accuracy, and societal implications. The goal is to understand the trade-offs between computational efficiency, accuracy, and privacy.

### Problem Solved
This project addresses the trade-off between accuracy and ethical implications in facial recognition. It demonstrates how CNNs achieve high accuracy, especially in challenging environments, while Eigenfaces offer simpler implementations with fewer privacy concerns.
