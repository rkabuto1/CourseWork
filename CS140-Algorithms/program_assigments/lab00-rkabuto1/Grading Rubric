● That should be a total of 100 points

● Things to keep in mind related to the questions for the second program:
– for( int i = 0; i < args.length; ++i )
● Since “++i” and “i++” don't use “i” anywhere else in the
statement, it seems like they should be equivalent

– for( int i = 0; i++ < args.length; )
● Since we are comparing “i” with args.length, and “i++”
increments “i” after using it in the statement (after comparing “i”
with args.length), we are comparing “i” with args.length, but we
are incrementing “i” to “i+1” before using it in the print statement

– for( int i = 0; ++i < args.length; )
● Since we are incrementing “i” prior to comparing it to args.length,
we are comparing “i+1” with args.length and also using “i+1” in
the print statement
