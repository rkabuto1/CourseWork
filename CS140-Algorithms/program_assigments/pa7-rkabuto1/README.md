Program Assignment 07 - Due 4/23, by 11:59 pm
----------------------------------------------

## Description 

For programming assignment 7 we will be implementing a `Car` class. The `Car` class will implement the `CarFunctions` interface. Most of the functions in the `CarFunctions` interface have default implementations, so that you can download the program files and compile immediately. You will need to override all of the `default` functions in your implementation of the `Car` class. I have provided an implementation of `Car.toString()`. Additionally we will be implementing the `ManageCarData` class, which implements the `ManageCarDataFunctions` interface. I have included `default` implementations for all of the methods in `ManageCarDataFunctions`, so that you can compile. I've posted in this repository the two interfaces, mostly empty versions of the two classes, an implementation of the `TotalRangeComparator` comparator and an empty version of the `RemainingRangeComparator` comparator. 

We will be making use of the fact that an interface can be used as a type. So, in the `ManageCarDataFunctions` and `ManageCarData` instead of returning lists of type `Car` we will be returning lists of type `CarFunctions`. This is also true for the comparators. This should make implememtation of the code a little easier. We are also doing similarly for programs that are used for testing, using `ManageCarDataFunctions` as the type for `ManageCarData` objects.

Note that I could not include a `default` version of `toString()` in the `CarFunctions` interface, since that would override the `toString()` method in `Object`. So, I included an implementation in the `Car` class.

I've also included `testCarData.java`, which you can use to exercise your code. You will need to change 
``` java 
ManageCarDataFunctions manageCarData = new your_last_name_in_lower_case_ManageCarData();
```
to the obvious thing in testCarData.java.

## Disclaimer 

**Note:** In the below, I may reference the `Car` class as either `Car` or `your_last_name_in_lower_case_Car`. And likewise for `ManageCarData` class.

## Motivation

This programming assignment is giving us additional experience with:
1. Creating classes and implementing methods
2. Creating `ArrayLists` and `PriorityQueues`
3. Working with `ArrayLists` and `PriorityQueues`
4. Using an `Iterator`
5. Searching an `ArrayList`
6. Comparing fields of an object to values
7. Comparing fields in multiple objects
8. Reading text files
9. Parsing text
10. Making copies of `ArrayLists` and `PriorityQueues`
11. Further insight as to how objects interact
	- Returning an original object in a method can have unintended effects
	- Returning original objects in a copy of a list can have unintended effects

-----------------------------------
Lab 11 - Due 4 / 11 by 11:59 pm
-----------------------------------

Time to take a quick detour. Lab11 is basically just getting started on implementing program assignment 07, to help you ensure that your `Car` class is being implemented correctly. [For lab11, please do all the details specified here, then push up your changes to github.](/lab11/README.md) The commit hash on brightspace should correspond to what you finish by the end of lab11:

```
git add -A
git commit -m "finished lab 11, rest of program assignment 07 will come later."
git push
git rev-parse HEAD
```

To be clear here, lab11 will be completely captured and graded here, in the program assignment 07 repository. There is no separate lab11 repository. Your grade for program assignment 07 will also be based upon this repository, just for another commit hash that you will submit later on, when you finish it in its entirety.

If you finish lab11 early in lab, you may continue on to implement the rest of programming assignment 07. See below.

# STOP! Do not continue below until you have finished lab 11 above

## Requirements

Below are the files and what they do and what you need to implement in each of them.

1. `CarFunctions.java`
	- Interface that specifies the methods that need to be implemented in the `Car` class
	- You don't need to make any changes to this file

2. `ManageCarDataFunctions.java`
	- Interface that specifies the methods that need to be implemented in the `ManageCarData` class
	- You don't need to make any changes to this file

3. `TotalRangeComparator.java`
	- Comparator for the the `PriorityQueue` of `CarFunctions` in total range and id order
	- You don't need to make any changes to this file

4. `RemainingRangeComparator.java`
	- Comparator for the the `PriorityQueue` of `CarFunctions` in remaining range and id order
	- You need to implement this class. You should use `TotalRangeComparator.java` as a guide as to what to do for this file.

5. `testCarData.java`
	- This program can be used for initial testing of your code.
	- Change the one occurrence of `your_last_name_in_lower_case_ManageCarData` to the obvious
	- You should make whatever changes you think are needed to sufficiently test your code in this file.

6. `your_last_name_in_lower_case_Car.java`
	- This is the `Car` class
	- Change the name in the obvious way
	- You will need to add four fields, which should be `private` and three of them should be `final`
		1. A `String` that identifies the instantiation of the `Car` class. I called mine `id` and will use that name in this program description.
		2. An `int` that stores the fuel economy in miles per gallon for the instantiation of the `Car` class. I called mine `fuelEconomyInMilesPerGallon` and will use that name in this program description.
		3. An `int` that stores the fuel capacity in gallons for the instantiation of the `Car` class. I called mine `fuelCapacityInGallons` and will use that name in this program description.
		4. A `double` that stores the current amount of fuel in gallons for the instantiation of the `Car` class. I called mine `currentFuelInGallons` and will use that name in this program description. This field will be updatable, so it cannot be `final`. The other three should be `final`.

	- You will need a four parameter constructor that assigns the four field values
	- You will need implementations of the following methods
		1. `public int getFuelEconomyInMilesPerGallon()`
			- Return the fuel economy in miles per gallon
		2. `public int getFuelCapacityInGallons()`
			- Return the fuel capacity in gallons
		3. `public double getCurrentFuelInGallons()`
			- Return the current fuel in gallons
		4. `public String getId()`
			- Return the id
		5. `public String toString()`
			- I've provided an implementation that should work
		6. `public void setCurrentFuelInGallons(double v)`
			- Update the current fuel in gallons
		7. `public double getTotalRangeInMiles()`
			- The default implementation of this should be sufficient
		8. `public double getRemainingRangeInMiles()`
			- The default implementation of this should be sufficient

7. `your_last_name_in_lower_case_ManageCarData.java`
	- This class is used to create instances of the `Car` class and manage getting the required data from the `Car` class
		1. `Car` objects will be assigned to variables of type `CarFunctions`
		2. For what this is worth, I only have one statement in my class that calls the `Car` constructor, and that is in the `readData` method
	- Change the name in the obvious way
	- You will need to add the following three fields, which should all be `private` and `final`
		1. An `ArrayList` of type `CarFunctions`. I called mine `carList` and will use that name in this program description.
		2. A `PriorityQueue` of type `CarFunctions` using the `TotalRangeComparator` comparator. I called mine `carListByTotalRange` and will use that name in this program description.
		3. A `PriorityQueue` of type `CarFunctions` using the `RemainingRangeComparator` comparator. I called mine `carListByRemainingRange` and will use that name in this program description.
	- A zero parameter constructor that instantiates the three fields
	- You will need implementations of the following methods
		1. public void readData(String filename)
			- You need to read the text file
				- For each line 
					1. Parse the id, fuel economy, fuel capacity, and current fuel
					2. Instantiate a new `Car` object with the above four values
					3. Add the `Car` object to the `ArrayList` and two `PriorityQueues`
	2. `public ArrayList<CarFunctions> getCarList()`
		- Return a copy of `carList`
		- We return a copy, since the code that made a call to the method could modify the `ArrayList`
		- I looped over the `carList` elements, and added each to the a new `ArrayList` of type `CarFunctions`, and returned that
		- This won't stop the calling method from changing the current fuel in the objects in the returned `ArrayList`, which would actually change the current fuel in `carList`, `carListByTotalRange`, and `carListByRemainingRange`
			- We could have made copies of each `Car` object as part of the copy to ensure that what we returned was completely independent of the fields of our `Car` class.
	3. `public PriorityQueue<CarFunctions> getCarListByTotalRange()`
		- Return a copy of `carListByTotalRange`
		- We return a copy, since if the code that made the call to the method ever does a `poll()` of the returned object, we don't want that to effect our original copy of the data.
		- I looped over the `carList` elements, and added each to the a new `PriorityQueue` of type `CarFunctions` instantiated with the appropriate comparator, and returned that
	4. `public ArrayList<CarFunctions> getCarListByTotalRangeUsingIterator()`
		- Create a new `ArrayList` of type `CarFunctions`
		- Create an `Iterator` of type `CarFunctions` for `carListByTotalRange`
		- Loop over the elements of `carListByTotalRange` using the iterator
		- Add each element of `carListByTotalRange` returned by the iterator to the `ArrayList`
		- Return the `ArrayList`
	5. `public PriorityQueue<CarFunctions> getCarListByRemainingRange()`
		- Return a copy of `carListByRemainingRange`
		- We return a copy, since if the code that made the call to the method ever does a `poll()` of the returned object, we don't want that to effect our original copy of the data.
		- I looped over the `carList` elements, and added each to the a new `PriorityQueue` of type `CarFunctions` instantiated with the appropriate comparator, and returned that
	6. `public ArrayList<CarFunctions> getCarListByRemainingRangeUsingIterator()`
		- Create a new `ArrayList` of type `CarFunctions`
		- Create an `Iterator` of type `CarFunctions` for `carListByRemainingRange`
		- Loop over the elements of `carListByRemainingRange` using the iterator
		- Add each element of `carListByRemainingRange` returned by the iterator to the `ArrayList`
		- Return the `ArrayList`
	7. `public ArrayList<String> getCarListByTotalRangeViaPoll(double minTotalRange, double maxTotalRange)`
		- Create a new `ArrayList` of type `String`
		- Loop over the elements of `carListByTotalRange` using the `poll()` method, this will return the elements of `carList` in total range in miles and then id order
			- For each element that has total range in `[minTotalRange,maxTotalRange]`:
				1. Call the current `Car` element `currentCar`
				2. Get the string representation of the `Car`, call it `currentCarString` (`currentCar.toString()` should be what you want)
				3. Loop over the `ArrayList` `carList` elements
					- If the current `carList` element is equal to `currentCar`, (note there will be exactly one), append a tab and the current index to `currentCarString`
						- You can use the `Object.equals()` to determine which element of `carList` is equal to `currentCar`
						- You can probably also use the `ArrayList.indexOf(Object o)` to accomplish this without using a loop
				4. Loop over the `ArrayList` `carList` elements
					- If the current `carList` element has the same fuel economy as `currentCar`, (note there will be at least one), append a tab and the current index to `currentCarString`
						- Use the `Car.getFuelEconomyInGallons()` method for the comparison of the two `Car`'s fuel economy
				5. **Note:** if you create two `Strings`, one for the index of the `Car` that equals the `currentCar` and one for the `Cars` that have the same fuel economy, you only need to loop over `carList` once, and then append the two to `currentCarString` after exiting the loop. This is what I did.
				6. Since `poll()` removes the elements from the `PriorityQueue`, at the end of the method you will need to add all of the elements back into the `PriorityQueue`, which can be done by looping over the elements of `carList`, and then using the `PriorityQueue.add()` method to add the current element of `carList` to `carListByTotalRange`

8. `public ArrayList<String> getCarListByRemainingRangeViaPoll(double minRemainingRange, double maxRemainingRange)`
	- Create a new `ArrayList` of type `String`
	- Loop over the elements of `carListByRemainingRange` using the `poll()` method, this will return the elements of `carList` in remaining range in miles and then id order
		- For each element that has remaining range in `[minRemainingRange,maxRemainingRange]`:
			1. Call the current `Car` element `currentCar`
			2. Get the string representation of the `Car`, call it `currentCarString` (`currentCar.toString()` should be what you want)
			3. Loop over the `ArrayList` `carList` elements
				- If the current `carList` element is equal to `currentCar`, (note there will be exactly one), append a tab and the current index to `currentCarString`
					- You can use the `Object.equals()` to determine which element of `carList` is equal to `currentCar`
					- You can probably also use the `ArrayList.indexOf(Object o)` to accomplish this without using a loop
			4. Loop over the `ArrayList` `carList` elements
				- If the current `carList` element has the same fuel economy as `currentCar`, (note there will be at least one), append a tab and the current index to `currentCarString`
					- Use the `Car.getFuelEconomyInGallons()` method for the comparison of the two `Car`'s fuel economy
			5. **Note:** If you create two `Strings`, one for the index of the `Car` that equals the `currentCar` and one for the `Cars` that have the same fuel economy, you only need to loop over `carList` once, and then append the two to `currentCarString` after exiting the loop. This is what I did.
			6. Since `poll()` removes the elements from the `PriorityQueue`, at the end of the method you will need to add all of the elements back into the `PriorityQueue`, which can be done by looping over the elements of `carList`, and then using the `PriorityQueue.add()` method to add the current element of `carList` to `carListByRemainingRange`

## Testing information

In my version of `testCarData`, I included the code below to verify that my code was returning copies of the `PriorityQueues`instead of the original objects. I will eventually also add something to verify that I returned a copy of the `ArrayList` of `CarFunctions` instead of the original object.

```java

// poll out the elements of the PriorityQueue ordered by remaining range 
PriorityQueue carsByRemaingRange = manageCarData.getCarListByRemainingRange();
while( carsByRemaingRange.size() > 0 )
{
	carsByRemaingRange.poll();
}
		
// poll out the elements of the PriorityQueue ordered by total range 
PriorityQueue carsByTotalRange = manageCarData.getCarListByTotalRange();
while( carsByTotalRange.size() > 0 )
{
	carsByTotalRange.poll();
} 
```

The above will cause any calls that happen after the above to output the `PriorityQueue` data to be empty if the original object was returned instead of a copy. I didn't include the code in the version of `testCarData` that I posted on github, since I didn't want that to slow your initial progress with the program.

## Returing copies

Returning a copy should not be a major endevour, below is how I do it for the `PriorityQueue` that orders the `Cars` by total range.

``` java
public PriorityQueue<CarFunctions> getCarListByTotalRange()
{
	PriorityQueue<CarFunctions> tempCarListByTotalRange = new PriorityQueue<>(new TotalRangeComparator());
	for( CarFunctions c : carList )
	{
		tempCarListByTotalRange.add(c);
	}
	return tempCarListByTotalRange;
}
```
