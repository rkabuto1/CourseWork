This project implements a directed graph structure with a breadth-first search (BFS) traversal algorithm to determine the sequence of courses across semesters based on prerequisites.The time complexity of this program is primarily driven by two operations which is graph initialization and BFS traversal. During graph initialization, each directed edge is added to an adjacency list, with a check to avoid duplicates. Overall the complexity is O(V+E)

This Folder Has
	1) Q1.h: Contains the declaration of the net class, which models the graph.
	2) Q1.cpp: Defines the methods of the net class and contains the main function to initialize and traverse the graph

To Run the Program
	1) Run "Make"
	2) Run "./Q1"
	3) See Output
	4) "Make Clean" to remove executables
