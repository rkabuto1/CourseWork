To Run the Program for Both Question2 and Question4 of the Extra Credit

1) Make

2) ./Q2 To Run Extra Credit For Question 2
   ./Q4 To Run Extra Credit For Question 4

3) Make Clean - To remove all the executables.

Question 2 Description) The primary task for Question 2 involves implementing the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) of three strings using dynamic programming. The runtime complexity of the algorithm id O(M × N × O ) where argM, argN, and argO are the lengths of the three input strings and the reason for this is because of the three loops that iterate through the table

Question 4 Description) To solve Question 4, we use Strassen’s Algorithm which instead of directly multiplying matrices in N^3 time, it divides matrices into smaller submatrices and recursively applies matrix operations to calculate the result in fewer multiplications, resulting in O(n^2.81 ). The code splits the input matrices into 4 quadrants, recursively computes the seven necessary products, and then combines them into the resulting matrix.
