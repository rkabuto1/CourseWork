# Simulation to Estimate the Mean Distance Between Random Points

Application to mobile computer networks. Computer scientists often model the movement of a mobile computer as a random path within a rectangle.
That is, two points are chosen at random within the rectangle, and the computer moves on a straight line from the first point to the second. In the study of mobile computer networks, it is important to know the mean length of a path (see the article "Station-ary Distributions for Random Waypoint Models," W.
Navidi and T. Camp, IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing, 2004:99-108). It is very difficult to compute this mean directly, but it is easy to estimate it with a simulation. This exercise presents a simulation experiment that is designed to estimate the mean distance between two points randomly chosen within a square of side 1. <br>
