# Catalyst Yield Analysis

## Question

A certain reaction was run several times using each of two catalysts, A and B. The catalysts were supposed to control the yield of an undesirable side product. Results, in units of percentage yield, for 24 runs of catalyst A and 20 runs of catalyst B are as follows:

### Catalyst A
```
4.4, 3.4, 2.6, 3.8, 4.9, 4.6, 5.2, 4.7, 4.1, 2.6, 6.7, 4.1, 
3.6, 2.9, 2.6, 4.0, 4.3, 3.9, 4.8, 4.5, 4.4, 3.1, 5.7, 4.5
```

### Catalyst B
```
3.4, 1.1, 2.9, 5.5, 6.4, 5.0, 5.8, 2.5, 3.7, 3.8, 3.1, 1.6, 
3.5, 5.9, 6.7, 5.2, 6.3, 2.6, 4.3, 3.8
```

### Tasks
1. Construct a histogram for the yields of each catalyst.
2. Construct comparative boxplots for the yields of the two catalysts.
3. Using the boxplots, what differences can be seen between the results of the yields of the two catalysts?
