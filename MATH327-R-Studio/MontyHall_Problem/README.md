# The Monty Hall Problem Simulation

The Monty Hall problem: If you are on a game show, and you are given a chance to pick one of
three doors. Behind one of the doors is a car and the rest are empty. If you randomly pick one
door, and the host, who knows where the car is located, will open an empty door out of the two
doors not picked.

#### A) What is the probability that the door you pick will be a winning door before the host reveals a door?

#### B) If you are offered a chance to switch your selection after the host reveals a door, should you take it?

#### C) What is the probability of winning after switching?

To calculate the probabilities, you will need to perform a lot of experiments/simulations. Each
experiment involves assigning the car randomly to one of the doors and picking one door of
your choice. Then reveals one of the doors not picked that is empty. Repeat the experiment
many times and calculate the proportion among all experiments that the car is behind the door
you pick before the revelations. After the revelations, calculate the proportions that the car is
behind the door you original pick and the one you do not pick.

### Instructions

To calculate the probabilities, you will perform a lot of experiments/simulations. Each experiment involves:
1. Assigning the car randomly to one of the doors.
2. Picking one door.
3. The host reveals one of the empty doors not picked.

You then calculate:
- The probability of the car being behind the initially picked door.
- The probability of winning if you **switch** your choice.
- The probability of winning if you **do not switch** your choice.
